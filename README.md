# Omniauth::Rails
A Rails Engine to make it as easy as possible to add oauth authentication to a Rails app.

Authorization is handled separately.

## TODO

What is a user authenticates, but does not have authorization? How do they "log out" so they can re-authenticate? The current (naive) logout does not allow this.

Search for "TODO" in the code.
